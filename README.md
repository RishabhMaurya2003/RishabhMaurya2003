About Me

I am Rishabh Maurya, a graduate with a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Rizvi College of Engineering, University of Mumbai (Class of 2024), and currently pursuing an M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering (started in 2024). With a strong academic foundation, reflected by my B.E. CGPA of 8.92, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the fields of healthcare, education, and sustainable development. I also have a strong interest in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), focusing on creating impactful solutions through data-driven approaches.

Projects

Drone Pathfinding for Disaster Areas: Developed a Python-based pathfinding algorithm for drones to navigate disaster-stricken areas. Implemented A* and Dijkstra's algorithms for optimal route planning, ensuring quick and efficient navigation.

Home Automation: Developed a smart home system integrating lighting, air conditioning, and security features using sensors, actuators, and centralized control systems. Utilized Arduino for hardware integration, IoT protocols for device connectivity, and a mobile app for centralized control, resulting in a 25% reduction in energy consumption and enhanced user convenience.

Sign Language Converter: Created a solution to translate sign language gestures into text or speech, bridging communication gaps for the hearing-impaired. Used computer vision techniques, OpenCV for gesture recognition, and TensorFlow for model training, achieving an accuracy of 85% on the validation set.

Emotion Detection: Implemented software capable of analyzing facial expressions or vocal tones to infer emotional states using machine learning algorithms. Employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for facial expression analysis and feature extraction, and fine-tuned pre-trained models to enhance accuracy.

Bookapp: Built a basic mobile application for book management using Flutter. Integrated Firebase for database management and user authentication, allowing users to add, delete, and search for books seamlessly.

Sanjhi Salon: Designed and developed a responsive salon website for both mobile and desktop viewing. Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a dynamic and visually appealing interface, improving user engagement by 40%.

College Recommendation System: Developed a machine learning-based system to assist students in selecting suitable colleges based on their academic profiles and preferences. Used scikit-learn for implementing recommendation algorithms and performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize predictions.
